I used the Page Object Model design pattern to represent UI elements for the webpages. I wanted them to be declarative, and separate the representation from the implementation. The implementation is done by classes implementing I\+Page\+Object\+Iplementor. I\+Page\+Object\+Implementor declares methods that take in a Page\+Element\+ID instance and returns either an I\+Clickable, I\+Readable, or I\+Inputable instance that represents a page element identified by the given Page\+Element\+ID instance.

I created one implementation of I\+Page\+Object\+Implementor, Web\+Driver\+Page\+Object\+Implementor. This implementation uses the Selenium Web\+Driver to map Page\+Element\+I\+Ds to actual web elements and perform user actions on them.

I also created a Scripts class in Scripts.\+cs that contains methods for reusable user actions.

There are also unit tests in Unit\+Tests/ to verify that the classes and pages are working as they should be.
